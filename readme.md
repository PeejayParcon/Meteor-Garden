# Project Title: Python Stopwatch

## Features
- Has a graphic user interface (GUI) that display all necessary data and controls
- Allows the user to determine the length of time that elapsed from the stopwatch's activation and deactivation
- Must have the following buttons:
  - Start
  - Stop
  - Split (Lap)
  - Reset
- Check out this video if you are unfamiliar with the functions of a stopwatch: [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW-w-E1P89A)
- You can add your own features as necessary, but make sure to cover the basic functionalities stated above

## Deliverables
- **Github repo** that contains your source code
- Video explaining your stopwatch and what’s novel about it
- First Google Form: the one that asks the link to your repo, and the members of your group
- Second Google Form: will be sending this one week before the deadline

## Scoring
- Source Code (15 *pts*)
- Github Repo(20 *pts*)
- Video (20 *pts*)
- Your Stopwatch Runs on My Computer (10 *pts*)
- X Factor (20 *pts*)

## Source Code
- Must be in Python and be fully compatible with Python 3.7.9
- Graphical UI Library can be either Tkinter/PyQt/Kivy
- Must have a file called **requirements.txt**. Research on what’s important about this file in the Python ecosystem.
- You can assign one/two members to research what are the best libraries to use for your project.
- Also, since we will be using git as our versioning system, make sure your source code has a file named .gitignore. Again, research the internet regarding the importance of this file

## Github Repo
- Your repo must have its main branch set to **master**. This is the branch that will be the basis of your scores. If there’s no master branch, you will automatically get a zero score for this exam. No excuses.
- All members should have committed at least once in the code base
- I should see one or two Pull Requests so that I can see that it’s not just one member that is carrying your entire group
- Your group must use Github’s builtin issue tracker to assign tasks between members. Plus points if you're using this to discuss stuff with your members.
- If github is foreign to you, you can assign one member to study it and have him/her discuss what he/she has researched to the group to make things more efficient.

## Video
- 1 to 2 minutes only
- Submit as mp4
- Minimal to no editing. No distracting and overly loud background music.
- Do not discuss any of your source code
- Highlight your stopwatch’s core features and what’s novel about it
- No need for everyone to appear in the video.
- Make sure that the speaker’s face is visible at least a few times
